# Map view
The map view displays your survey and allows you to interact with it.
Unless like other programs out there, **StickMaps** actually encourages you to interact with the map as much as possible.
**StickMaps** allows you to do so by providing:

- Adding lines to your map using Drag&Drop
- Doing loop-closures using Drag&Drop
- Allowing you to `right-click` every station on the map in order to view or edit its contents.
- Allowing you the `right-click` every line on the map in order to view or edit its contents.
- Allowing you to `right-click` anywhere on the map and add custom markers.
