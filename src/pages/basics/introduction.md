# Introduction

**StickMaps** is a program to create stick-maps using compass-based survey data.
It is ideal for (underwater) cave survey, creating path based maps of archaeological sites or other points of interest.
**StickMaps** main focus is to provide simple and fun solutions for visualizing survey data in a practical and usable way.

- Clean and straight-forward interface.
- Natural Drag&Drop based user-interaction.
- Dynamic data visualisation.
- Supporting various import methods and devices.

## Batteries included?
**StickMaps** is not a "Batteries included" application, meaning that we intentionally will not support all your needs.
For instance, if you want to produce a map based on your stickmap, we think you will be better off using a tool like 
[InkScape](https://inkscape.org/) or [Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) for that.
This allows us to focus on the features we value most and keep our program clean, simple and fun to work with.
